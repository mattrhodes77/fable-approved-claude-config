#!/usr/bin/env bash
# check-careful.sh — PreToolUse hook on Bash.
#
# Goal: stop nagging on routine cleanup, and when it DOES ask, ask in plain
# English a human can actually answer.
#
# For `rm -r`: every delete target is classified. If all targets are
# routine/regenerable (virtualenvs, build caches, test DBs, temp/log files)
# the command is ALLOWED SILENTLY. If any target isn't recognized, the prompt
# lists each item with a ✓ (routine) or ⚠ (please check) and a plain label —
# not a regex verdict. Other rare-but-catastrophic commands (true force-push,
# SQL DROP/TRUNCATE, kubectl delete, docker prune) get a plain-English warning.
#
# Deletes NEVER block a goal/loop. Because a /goal is an undetectable Stop hook
# (no env/stdin/file signal), the hook can't know whether a loop is driving it —
# so it never prompts on a delete in ANY context: recognized-safe deletes run
# silently; an unrecognized ⚠ delete is DEFERRED (not run) and appended as JSON
# to ~/.claude/cleanup-needed.log for a later cleanup sweep (/cleanup, /wrapup,
# /PRlaunch resolve it; babysit surfaces it). The only interactive prompt left
# is for rare non-delete catastrophes (force-push, SQL DROP, kubectl/docker).
#
# Loop-mode (~/.claude/hooks/loop-mode): only affects those non-delete commands
# now — when armed, they auto-proceed instead of prompting. See loop-mode-arm.sh
# and cleanup-sweep.py.
#   enable:  ~/.claude/hooks/loop-mode-arm.sh [minutes]   (or: touch the file)
#   disable: rm ~/.claude/hooks/loop-mode
# Adapted from garrytan/gstack careful/bin/check-careful.sh.
