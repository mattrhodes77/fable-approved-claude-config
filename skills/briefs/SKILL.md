# briefs — the worker-brief contract for subagent prompts

**Worker quality is downstream of brief quality.** A fresh subagent knows nothing but its prompt: no session history, no working-tree state, no sense of what "the checkout" means. An ad-hoc brief varies run-to-run — one worker gets the branch, the next assumes `main`; one gets a return schema, the next free-writes prose the orchestrator can't parse. This skill fixes the shape: **every worker prompt an orchestrator emits carries the same six sections, in order, filled.** The structure converts judgment a strong model applies implicitly into fill-in slots a weaker worker can't silently skip.

Use this any time an orchestrator skill spawns a worker: `bulldozer` ticket workers, `deep-review` finder/refuter agents, `babysit-prs` fixers, `assign` discovery agents, `skillify` authors — or any new orchestrator that fans out.

## The six required sections

Every brief MUST contain all six, each labeled, in this order. A section that "doesn't apply" is a smell — say why explicitly rather than dropping it.

### 1. CONTEXT
State the repo, the **exact branch or commit ref the worker must trust** — never "the checkout", never "the current tree" (the worker has no shared filesystem view and the tree may be mid-edit by someone else). Give 2–3 sentences of situation: what's already been done, why this worker exists, what surrounds the task. When the worker must NOT trust working-tree state — because another agent owns those files, or the ref is a moving target — inline the actual file contents or a diff into the brief so the worker reads from the prompt, not from disk.

### 2. TASK
One outcome, stated as **the artifact to produce** — "return a JSON verdict on whether EX-3803 still reproduces", "open a PR fixing the null-guard in `api/x.py`". Not a topic ("look into the bug"), not a bundle of three things. If you're tempted to write "and also", it's two briefs.

### 3. CONSTRAINTS
The scope fences that keep the worker in its lane: never merge, never reassign a ticket, read-only, path allowlist, don't touch files another agent owns. Then paste the relevant **gotchas verbatim** — the zsh word-split trap, the "list_issues blows the token cap" warning, whatever bit the last run. Verbatim, because a paraphrased gotcha is a gotcha the worker will re-learn the hard way.

### 4. RETURN CONTRACT
The exact schema/format of the reply, **with a filled example**. Prefer JSON with named keys — the orchestrator parses it, so ambiguity here becomes a parse failure or a wrong write. Say what each key means and what an empty/failure value looks like. If the reply is prose, give the exact headings expected.

### 5. VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT
What the worker must **RUN** before claiming success — the test command, the build, the `git show` that proves the change landed, the reproduction that now passes. Evidence before assertion (global rule #1). Make explicit: **if the outcome can't be verified, the worker reports failure honestly** rather than asserting success it didn't observe.

### 6. STOP CONDITIONS
When to bail instead of thrashing, and **what to return when it bails** so the orchestrator can act. Mirror the global 3-strikes / two-dead-ends rule: after ~2 failed attempts at the same fact or fix, stop and report the blocker with what was tried — don't burn the budget grinding. Name the specific dead-ends for this task (premise contradicted, ref missing, tests already red on checkout) and the shape of the "I stopped" return.

## Worked example — a bulldozer-style ticket worker

```
CONTEXT: Repo is acme-api (a fictional repo for this example). Trust ONLY
origin/main at commit a1b2c3d (fetched this session) — do NOT read the live
working tree; another worker is editing it. The ticket EX-0000 claims
`send_reminder()` in api/notify.py double-sends when a user has two active
bookings. You are one isolated worker; the orchestrator is draining a queue
and will not see your context, only your returned JSON.

TASK: Produce an opened PR that makes `send_reminder()` send exactly one
reminder per user per booking-window, with a regression test that fails on
a1b2c3d and passes on your fix.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Work in an isolated worktree on branch me/ex-0000-dedupe-reminders. Never
  commit to main, never merge, never touch the ticket's Linear state yourself.
- Path allowlist: api/notify.py and tests/test_notify.py only.
- Gotcha (verbatim): pytest here needs `ENV=test` or it hits prod Postgres —
  `ENV=test uv run pytest tests/test_notify.py`.

RETURN CONTRACT: reply with exactly this JSON, no prose around it:
{
  "ticket": "EX-2991",
  "status": "pr_opened" | "blocked",
  "pr_url": "<url or null>",
  "test_cmd": "<exact command you ran>",
  "test_result": "<pass/fail summary you observed>",
  "notes": "<one line, or the blocker if status=blocked>"
}

VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT: before returning status "pr_opened" you MUST run the
regression test and observe it fail on a1b2c3d, then pass on your branch. Paste
the observed pass line into test_result. If you cannot make it fail-then-pass,
return status "blocked" — do not claim a fix you didn't watch work.

STOP CONDITIONS: if the double-send does NOT reproduce on a1b2c3d after 2
honest attempts (the premise is wrong), or the allowlisted files don't contain
`send_reminder`, stop and return status "blocked" with notes naming what you
found instead. Do not widen the path allowlist to go hunting.
```

## The classifier-fleet pipeline

Some orchestrators don't fan out to *build* — they fan out to *classify/validate at scale*, reconciling a large set of claims against ground truth. This shape recurs enough to name: **deterministic pre-pass → read-only classifier/validator fleet → single-writer applies → verify counts → memory_write.**

1. **Deterministic pre-pass.** Establish ground truth once, cheaply, with plain commands — not agents. Pull the decisive facts up front (e.g. each repo's `git log`, which commits are ancestors of a live box's HEAD) and inject the result as a routing hint into each worker's brief. Agents shouldn't spend budget re-deriving what a `git log`/`grep` already answered.
2. **Read-only classifier/validator fleet.** One six-section brief per item, fanned out in parallel. Each worker classifies its item and returns a structured verdict — it proposes, it never writes. Read-only is what makes wide fan-out safe: a bad classification is a wrong string, not a wrong write.
3. **Single-writer applies.** One writer turns verdicts into writes — either the orchestrator itself, or one narrow, mechanical apply-brief per item. Route any write that can fork a record (one verdict becoming two tickets, a split) through the orchestrator by hand, never an agent: independent workers racing on the same write path is exactly how a split mis-applies to the wrong record.
4. **Verify counts.** After applying, re-pull the target collection and assert the count matches the expected kept-set. Don't trust a worker's self-reported "what I did" field — assert the actual post-state, because a worker can silently do more than it was told and misreport it.
5. **memory_write.** Close the sweep by persisting what was found/decided so the next run doesn't re-derive it from scratch (skip this step if you don't run a persistent-memory tool).

**`flushdeployed` is the existing end-to-end exemplar of stages 1–4**: its per-repo `git log`, pre-computed live-vs-pending recon IS the deterministic pre-pass; `validate-workflow.js`'s one-agent-per-ticket, read-only (`apply=false`) verdicts ARE the classifier fleet; the orchestrator hand-doing every `PARTIAL` split plus the narrow `apply-done-workflow.js` for the mechanical Done/note writes ARE the single-writer stage; and its "re-pull the Deployed column, assert `count == expected-kept-set`" step IS verify-counts.

### Worked example — a read-only classifier/validator brief

```
CONTEXT: Repo is acme-services (fictionalized values below). Trust ONLY the
prod ground truth given here — do not re-derive it: origin/main HEAD is
a1b2c3d; the live EC2 box is at e4f5a6b (`git merge-base --is-ancestor` a
commit against e4f5a6b tells you if it's actually live). You are one of N
parallel read-only workers; a single orchestrator applies all verdicts after
every worker returns — you never write the tracker yourself.

TASK: Return a structured verdict on whether ticket EX-3217 ("Fix
double-charge on renewal") is genuinely live in prod, not just merged.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Read-only: propose an action, do not call any tracker write tool.
- Don't trust a merge commit alone — confirm the actual fixed code is present
  in origin/main (`git show origin/main:<path>`), not just a commit subject
  match; catches reverts and no-op merges.
- Gotcha (verbatim): a failed merge-search alone is NOT enough to call
  WRONG_NOT_DEPLOYED — when unsure between WRONG and UNCERTAIN, pick
  UNCERTAIN.

RETURN CONTRACT: reply with exactly this JSON:
{
  "id": "EX-3217",
  "verdict": "DEPLOYED_LIVE" | "MERGED_PENDING_DEPLOY" | "PARTIAL" | "WRONG_NOT_DEPLOYED" | "UNCERTAIN",
  "evidence": "<commit hash + file:line proving present/absent>",
  "proposed_action": "move_to_done" | "note_keep_deployed" | "split_then_done" | "note_move_to_todo" | "note_only_manual",
  "confidence": "high" | "medium" | "low"
}

VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT: before returning a verdict other than UNCERTAIN, you
MUST have actually run the merge-search and the ancestor check this session
and quote their output in "evidence" — a verdict with no command behind it is
not a verdict.

STOP CONDITIONS: if you can't find the merge AND can't positively confirm the
fix is absent, return UNCERTAIN with confidence "low" and evidence naming what
you checked — do not guess WRONG_NOT_DEPLOYED off a failed search alone.
```

## Adopters

These orchestrator skills each spawn workers and must reference this template when they build a worker prompt: **bulldozer** (per-ticket workers), **deep-review** (finder/refuter agents), **babysit-prs** (CodeRabbit-fix workers), **assign** (discovery agents), **skillify** (skill-author workers), **flushdeployed** (deployed-ticket validator/apply fleet — the end-to-end exemplar of the classifier-fleet pipeline above). Their edits to point at this contract land separately — this file is the canonical source they cite, not a change to those skills.
